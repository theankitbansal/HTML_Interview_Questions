Introduction

Before starting with the interview questions on HTML Language, let’s first go through HTML, what is HTML, the career opportunities it provides, etc.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup language. It is a standard text formatting language used for developing web pages released in 1993. HTML is a language that is interpreted by the browser and it tells the browser what to display and how to display.

HTML is an important language to learn if anyone wants to work in the web development domain [Web designers, Web Developers]. HTML alone is not sufficient for a web developer because HTML only defines the structure of the data that will be rendered on the browser in a webpage, to make it visually appealing and to make it functional, we will need to use CSS and Javascript respectively. 

The latest version of HTML is HTML5. There are two main components in HTML language, Tags and Attributes. The below image shows some basic HTML tags and attributes.
